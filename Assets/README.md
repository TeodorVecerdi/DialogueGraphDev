<b>DialogueGraph</b> is an open-source editor tool for the [Unity](https://unity.com/) game engine used to create branching conversation trees in an easy and straighforward way by connecting nodes, and setting up conditions and triggers for the different conversation branches. An obvious use case for this tool is to create conversations with NPCs, although the versatility of this tool allows for any kind of project that requires branching behaviour based on checks and triggers.

This project is developed for a self-defined learning objective that is part of the Personal Portfolio 1 course at Saxion.
